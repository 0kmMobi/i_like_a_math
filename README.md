The application can share messages (for example, through any messenger) with an invitation to invent any digit and any three-digit number. 
After that, you can share an image of a mathematical expression equal to the invented number and using only the invented digit.

Technically, this little application has the following features:
1. Built according to the concept of clean architecture;
2. Has full coverage of unit tests and integration tests;
3. Localization for 2 languages;
4. Can share a text and a rendered widgets;
